File2 to test push pull

add new file in GitHub to GitBash:
1. Create new file in repo in GitHub
2. Commit button in GitHub
3. go to GitBash and "git pull"
4. "ls" to list and see the new file name added

for updates and edits, check with "vi File2" and see inside it

if MERGE CONFLICT:
1. pull from GitHub,  to GitBash (update)
2. add files
3. commit
4. push
(this is the general remedy, each scenerio is diff)

git log -> commit history
